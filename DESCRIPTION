Description: GNU Make is the defacto standard for efficiently
             rerunning appropriate steps in the data analysis or
             reporting process if a particular file is changed. Only
             the necessary steps are rerun. The gnumaker package makes
             if easy to create and use GNU Makefiles to aid a
             reproducible work flow for data analysis projects.
